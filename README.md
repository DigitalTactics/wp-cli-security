# wp-cli-security
A security scanner extension for WP-CLI (alpha)

This extension to WP-CLI is designed to perform a server side security scan of a WordPress installation looking for known types vulnerability and typical PHP hack patterns.

It will be cronable if desired and help users identify and rectify issues with their WP installation should they be compromised. 

This not a preventative tool and is not designed to replace other common plugins such as Wordfence or ithemes security for example (though we may introduce scans for best practice implementation at some point).

This project is currently very much in an alpha state but will hopefully grow rapidly by building atop similar tools and with the support of the community.

vs. other similar tools currently available we hope to produce a WordPress specific solution with a simple and understood cli interface facilitated by WP-CLI.
